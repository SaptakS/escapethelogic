This is a website where we share our interest and love for escape rooms in general while also
conveying our experience and review of various escape rooms that we have been to. The more rooms
we visit, we keep updating about them in our posts. Most of the rooms are in India but also from time
to time we will try and write about escape rooms that we visit outside India.
