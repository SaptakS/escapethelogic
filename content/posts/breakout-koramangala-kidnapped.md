Sayan: Hey why you didn't come to the Escape room, we are waiting for you.
 
Me: When did you ask me to come over?
 
Knock knock on my door and Saptak was on the door.
 
Me: What are you doing here.
 
Saptak: Let's go for the Escape room.
 
Me: Sure I just got a call and Sayan called me.
 
Saptak: But he is downstairs.
 
Me: Ok, let's go then.
 
That's how we ended up to the [Breakout](https://breakout.in/bengaluru-koramangala/).
 
### Breakout Koramangala
One of the good escape rooms in Bangalore and the folks are really good, supportive and ready to manage things on a quick request. In Breakout not only you have to escape the room, but also you have to solve the mystery. They usually ask questions at the end of the game.
 
### The Room - Kidnapped
The name [Kidnapped](https://breakout.in/bengaluru-koramangala/#gds_2) is self-explanatory for what it's all about. The story behind this room, a small girl kidnapped and there are super cops(players) who are gonna find out the girl and the kidnappers.
 
#### Ambience
Upon entering it felt like a desolated mill, a perfect place for kidnappers. It felt like people just left. Sometimes it was getting darker and that was challenging to find out the other clues.
 
#### Clues
Most of the hidden clues were easy to find. The dark ambience often made it challenging to find out some of the clues. It took approx twenty-one minutes to solve 90% of the game. Some of the clues were interesting but most of them were pretty simple.

#### Difficulty
This is a really nice room for the people who don't have much experience with escape rooms. But for frequent visitors it might seem a little slow and easy at some stages.
