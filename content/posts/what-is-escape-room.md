### What is an Escape Room?

If I had to explain in one line, escape room is a time bound (usually 60 mins) real-life theme-based adventure game. If you have ever played a treasure hunt or scavenger hunt, it is kind of similar to that. It is a team game. You and your team will be locked in a themed room for a certain time (usually 60 mins) and within this time you have to find your way out of the room.

Some of the common themes are:

* **Prison Break** - You have to get out of a prison cell
* **Murder Mystery** - Someone has been murdered! You need to find the murderer and escape with evidence.
* **Kidnapped** - You need to find the ransom or the kidnapped person and escape
* **Archaeological** - You are an archaeologist or journalist, unravelling hidden treasures in old temples, pyramids, etc and escaping with the treasure.
* **Horror** - You are trapped in a horror themed room (vampire outburst, haunted house, catacombs, etc.) and you need to find your way out of that room.
* **Fantasy** - You are trapped in an enchanted world and you need to solve all clues to escape or rescue someone.

While some rooms and locations are more focused on puzzles and riddles and logical problems and number locks, others are more focused on thinking out-of-the-box and performing certain actions that triggers certain sensors to take you to the next clue. Some rooms focus more on the actual puzzles and logic, while others focus on giving you a more immersive experience.

Well, guess what, escape room is your chance to live those lives.And the best part? Well you can chose to live a different life every other day (even though only for about an hour)!

### Who can go to an Escape Room?

Most escape rooms are meant from ages 9 to 90. So it doesn't really matter what your age is. As long as you love a good adventure and solve mysteries, you are gonna have a lot of fun.

One can use an escape rooms as a team building activity. I have even seen people celebrating birthday parties in escape rooms where they would hide the birthday presents behind one of the locks. A usual size of a team expected is 2 to 8, so maybe you can even go for dates to an escape room!


In the end, I think everyone should definitely try out escape rooms at least once. It's a new unique way of having fun with your friends, colleagues or family. It often brings out the hidden talents within one towards problem solving.
